Applied cryptography engineer at the Ethereum Foundation. I work on privacy systems for institutions — ZK proofs, MPC protocols, and the messy work of making research actually run in production.

I took a non-linear path: MSc in Management, self-taught coder at 28, now designing cryptographic infrastructure. I share what I'm building, what breaks, and how I think through hard problems.

Currently focused on: confidential token standards, institutional DeFi privacy, and the gap between what's possible and what's adoptable.

Also into: music production, fitness (swimming + gym + running), learning new things.
